/**
 * <p>
 *     A state has various important tasks it must attend to:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>success; when a character points to another state, it must return that state</li>
 *     <li>failure; when a character has no matching state, the algorithm must be able to fall back on a
 *         state with less depth</li>
 *     <li>emits; when this state is passed and keywords have been matched, the matches must be
 *         'emitted' so that they can be used later on.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *     The root state is special in the sense that it has no failure state; it cannot fail. If it 'fails'
 *     it will still parse the next character and start from the root node. This ensures that the algorithm
 *     always runs. All other states always have a fail state.
